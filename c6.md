# Class 6 Dynamic Web Pages with Javascript

## JS Intro Paragraph

- **Javascript**: is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions
- Javascripts capabilities include:
  - runtime object construction
  - variable parameter lists
  - function variables
  - dynamic script creation
  - object introspection
  - source code recovery

- Javascript and Java have different syntax, semantics, and use

### Editor or IDE

- You can use notepad built into MS but something more powerful is recommended

### Embed or Include

- You can either embed the script code directly to HTML file or you can put a line in the HTML that includes the external JavaScript file

### Input Output

- There are a number of way JavaScript can display text for the user (output).

### alert

- This will show a pop-up in the browser with the text

### document.write

- The JavaScript code uses the document.write function to change the content of the page.

### console.log

- Web browsers provide a "JavaScript console", a window that is normally not visible, where the browser can print out warnings and errors generated by the execution of the JavaScript code
- Developers can print information to this console using the console.log() call

### prompt

- It will show a pop-up window with the text provided as the first parameter and with a textbox the user can fill in
- When user presses OK, the value in the text box will be returned by the prompt() function

### confirm

- The other pop-up is not really an input method but it allows the developer to ask a Yes/No question

### Functions in JavaScript

- In JavaScript we use the function keyword for this followed by the name of the new function
- Then the list of parameters in parentheses and then a block of expressions in curly braces

### Calling a function more than once

- They can help eliminate code repetition

### On-load counter with JavaScript and local storage

- In HTML5 localStorage is a term used for a flat key-value database inside the browser that can be accessed using JavaScript
- As the counter is saved in your own browser, this number will be independent of what other people see, or what you'll see if you visit the same page using a different device or even a different browser on the same devide

### JavaScript Hello World - changing the DOM with getElementById and innerHTML

- **Document Object Model (DOM)**: is basically the representation of the HTML page by JavaScript objects
- When we used document.write in introduction we changed the HTML, which also changed the DOM
- regardless the location of our JavaScript we can access and change any part of the DOM and thus and part of the HTML
-In order to be able to change a DOM object, first we need to fetch the object

### Handling user events in JavaScript

- addEventListener method of a DOM element, that will get two parameters:
  - The first one is the name of the event, such as click or keyup, or change
  - The second one is a function

### Input Output in plain JavaScript

- In the JavaScript code we have a function called say_hi
- It used the getElementById representing the input element with the id first_name
- We use this technique to retrieve the content of both input fields and assign their content to two variables:
  -fname
  -lname

### Ajax request for JSON data with vanilla JavaScript

- One of important aspects of modern web application is the behind-the-scenes, asynchronous data communication between the server and the JavaScript code running in the browser
- All the code that is relevant to sending the asynchronous request was placed in a function called ajax_get
- This function expects two parameters:
  - the URL we request
  - a function which will be called when the response arrives from the server

### TODO in HTML5 and plain JavaScript

- The 3 important lines are the following:
  - At first we have an input element where we'll be able to enter text and it has a button that we'll be able to click
  - In the second row we have an empty div element
  - Finally we load an external JavaScript file called todo.js

### The "database"

- **localStorage**: a key-value pair database in the browser.

### Fetching from the database: get_todos

- As this function used by all the other functions, let's see the get_todos function first. It does not get any parameter
- fetches the content of the todo key of the localStorage using the getItem method

### Adding a new TODO entry

- The second function we might want to take a look at is the one called add which is called when the user has clicked on the all button

### show the TODO list

- The show function will display the current TODO list stored in the "database"
- first thing it calls get_todos to get the (possibly empty) Array of TODO items
- then we manually create an HTML snippet in the, otherwise arbitrarily named html variable

### remove a TODO item

- Finally we arrive to the remove function that will be called when the user clicks on any of the remove buttons
- this represents the current DOM-object which is the remove-button the user just clicked
- After retrieving the current list of TODO items, we use the splice method to remove a specific element from the JavaScript array, and then we store the new list back the database

## Variables

### What are Variables?

- **variables**: containers for storing data

### When to Use JavaScript const?

- A variable where you know the value will not change
- If you think the value of a variable is going to change use let

### Just Like Algebra

- Like algebra, variables hold values
- are also used in expressions

### JavaScript Identifiers

- All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names\
- These unique names are called identifiers
- The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:
  - Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs
  - Names must begin with a letter
  - Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
  - Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)
  - Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names

### The Assignment Operator

- The equal sign (=) is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator

### JavaScript Data Types

- JavaScript variables can hold numbers like 100 and text values like "John Doe"
- In programming, text values are called text strings

### Declaring a JavaScript Variable

- Creating a variable in JavaScript is called "declaring" a variable
- You declare a JavaScript variable with the let keyword

### One Statement, Many Variables

- You can declare many variables in one statement

### Value = undefined

- A variable declared without a value will have the value undefined
- The variable carName will have the value undefined after the execution of this statement

### Re-Declaring JavaScript Variables

- The variable carName will still have the value "Volvo" after the execution of these statements
