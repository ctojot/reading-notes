# Express, NPM, TDD, CI/CD

## An Introduction to Node

### Explain middleware, answer as though I were a non-technical recruiter.

Middleware are tools that help you connect different pieces of software allowing them to work and communicate with each other.

### Express the most popular __ __ ____.

Express is the most popular Node web framework.

### Express is “unopinionated.” What does that mean?

Express being unopinionated means that is has fewer restrictions on how to put components together or what components to use making it easier for devs to use more sutiable tools for what they need.

### What is a module and why is modularity useful to us as developers?

A module is a JavaScript library/file that you can import into other code using Node's require() function.

## What is NPM?

NPM is a software registry that allows you to share and borrow packages and also manage private development

### What version of npm are you running on your machine?

9.8.1

### What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’ into your node project?

npm install jshint

## What is TDD

### Explain why tests are important. Please explain as though I were your non technical elder.

Testing is important cause you want to make sure that the program works. The more frequently you run test,the earier it is to spot any errors earlier than later.

### What are three expected benefits of testing

- Reduced defect rates
- By the final stages of development, less effort is needed
- Improved design qualities in code

### Name at lest 2 individual pitfalls and at least 2 team pitfalls commonly encountered while writing tests

Individual:

- Forgetting to run tests frequently
- writing too many tests at once

Team:

- Only few developers on a team will use tests
- Poor maitenance of test suite

## CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery)

### What are three benefits of Continuous Integration?

- It will improve your collaboration skills
- You can find errors much earlier and easily traceable
- Your coding will improve in quality because you are taking steps be consistent

### What is the difference between Continuos Delivery and Continuous Deployment?

- Continuos devliery, deployment to production is done manually while with Continuous Deployment is fully automated
- Continuous delivery ensures that the code is in a deployable state and will sit until the decision to deploy the production is manually made by a human. With Continuos deployment, once code changes are commited, the changes are pushed to prod enviornment as long as they pass all test.

### Explain how GitHub fits into this process assuming the listener comes from a non-technical background

Github is basically a filing cabinet for software development. You use it to store code. You can track any changes that happens to it. Work with a team member with whatever is inside. Github even assits with automated testing and also making sure all your code is working before you go live with it.

## Things I want to know more about

What I really want to know more about is how people were even creating software before Github was even created.
