# Component Base UI

## React Quick Start

### What are the building blocks of a React app?

React apps are made out of components.

### What is the difference between an HTML element and a React component?

React component names must always start with a capital letter, while HTML tags must be lowercase.

### What is JSX and why do we use it?

JSX is HTML but stricter. Most React projects use JSX for its convenience.

### Describe the process of embedding JavaScript expressions in JSX

JSX lets you put markup into JavaScript. Curly braces let you “escape back” into JavaScript so that you can embed some variable from your code and display it to the user

### Does React or JSX have any special features for iteration or conditional logic?

There is no special syntax for conditional logic.

### How does React know to respond to a user’s inputs?

By using event handlers

### What word indicates that a React component manages data with a Hook?

The word use.

### How can two react components share data?

By using props or using context

## Render and Commit

### What are the three steps of refreshing a React UI?

- Triggering
- Rendering
- Commiting

### How do you trigger updates to a component after the initial render?

Updates are triggered by using setState, useState, or passing props

### Does React recreate DOM nodes on every rerender?

No, React updates the DOM to reflect changes

### After React has updated the DOM, what still needs to happen before the user sees the change?

The browser needs to repaint and reflow the updated DOM.

## Additional Questions

### Note the naming conventions in the Airbnb React/JSX Style Guide. What pattern(s) do you see?

The patterns I see are a lot of HTML that we've learned previously.

### Looking ahead at this module’s course schedule, What do you look forward to learning?

I'm looking forward to learning React Native

### What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?

The goal is to be better at Front-end over Back-end cause I think it was a lot harder than I anticipated.
