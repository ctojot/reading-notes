## Web Sockets

### What is a Web Socket?

A Web Socket is a communication protocol that enables real-time, bidirectional data transfer between a client and server.

### Describe the Web Socket request/response handshake and what happens once the connection is established.

The Web Socket handshake involves an initial HTTP request, followed by an upgrade to the Web Socket protocol. Once the connection is established, data can be exchanged without the need for prior client requests.

### Web Sockets provide a standardized way for the server to send content to a client without first receiving a ____ from that client.

## Socket.io Tutorial

### What does the event handler io.on() do?

The event handler io.on() in Socket.io is used to listen for specific events from clients and execute code in response.

### Describe some possible proof of life or proof that the code works as expected

Using console logs or emit events in the server and client confirms data exchange between the 2.

### What does socket.emit() do?

It's used to create and fire custom events.

## Socket.io vs Web Sockets

### What is the difference between WebSocket and Socket.IO? (think Git and GitHub, or OAuth and Auth0).

WebSocket is a protocol that provides communication channel over a single TCP connection. Socket.io is a library built on top of Websocket and other transport technologies.

### When would you use Socket.IO?

When you want to handle the various support level and the inconsistencies from the browser

### When would you use WebSockets?

Wehn you require full duplex communication on TCP connections.

The OSI Model is framework that defines seven layers (Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Applcation) to describe how different networking and communication protocols work together to enable communication between devices in on a network.
