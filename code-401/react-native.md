# React Native

## Getting Started With React Native

### Name three Core Components of React Native and describe what they do.

- View: A container that supports layout with flexbox, style, some touch handling, and accessibility controls
- Text: Displays, styles, and nests strings of text and even handles touch events
- Image: Displays different types of images

### What problem does React Native solve (why call it native)?

React Native allows developers to create iOS/Android apps with JavaScript and React. It's called native because it uses native React components.

### What are the building blocks of a React Native app? How does that compare to a React app?

The building blocks of a React Native app are the core components such as view, text and image. They use the same API structure as a regular React App.

## Expo

### What solution does expo provide?

Expo allows devs to create Android/iOS apps with a full ecosystem of tools to help create with React Native.

### Expo tries to manage as much of the complexity of building apps as possible, which is why we call it the ____ workflow.

managed workflow

### What is the difference between React Native and Expo?

React is a framework create to allow developers to build mobile applications with React and JavaScript. Expo is a set of tools and services built around React Native to simplify the development process.

## Expo Snack

### Checkout this tool. What does snack allow you to do?

Snack lets you develop and preivew mobile apps from the web browser.

## ejecting

### What does “eject” mean within the context of Expo?

Used to describe leaving the cozy comfort of the standard Expo development environment, where you do not have to deal with build configuration or native code.

### When should you not eject?

You should not eject from Expo if you want to keep the simplified development process of the app you are building.

### Why might you choose to eject?

You would choose to eject if you want more control over the code and the dependencies of the project

## Additional Questions

### Looking ahead at this module’s course schedule, What do you look forward to learning?

I actually am hyped about building a mobile app. I had this stupid goal of recreating flappy bird when I started coding so I want to see if it's do-able with React Native.

### What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?

My goal is to focus is utilizing the tools properly when creating a mobile app.
