# Growth Mindset

## Upgrade your technical skills with deliberate practice

I believe this topic matter beacuse I've always believed that practice makes perfect. I used to play instruments in highschool and I know for a fact that I would not get better unless I practiced. The same goes for coding. If I don't practice the things I'm not good at I will never get better. I feel that the common thing that some people will do is either continue to make the same mistakes or I will avoid having to do something they don't know how to do. Sometimes you have to fight the urge to do it. One thing that I was really bad at was positioning things in CSS. I'm still not the best at it, but I try to work on it when I have time and I can definitely feel that I'm much better at it now.

## Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset

This topics matters so much. In order to develop into something greater, a growth mindset is necessary. I personally don't enjoy settling when it comes to coding at all. I don't just do the work cause I need it for the grade, I do them to become the best coder I can possibly be. As Carol Dweck said,"...students with a fixed mind-set that confronted an error ran away from it. Those with growth mindset engaged with the error believing abilities can be developed." (Dweck, 2014) Those that face problems head on are the ones that are going to strive to do bigger and better things in the furute. They are not afraid to fail cause they see it as a learning experience to become better.

## Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit

This topic is very important because some of us do not know how to build grit. To be completely honest, I don't have have much grit but I'm trying to work on it. As Lee states in the video, "Grit is passion and perserverance for long term goals" (Lee, 2013). You need grit when it comes to any goal in my opinion. Sometimes you don't know what life is going to throw at you, but you need to try your best to keep your goals in your mind. It will definitely pay off in the long run.

## Alain de Botton on Redefining Success

I relate to this topic so much. I never finished college. Prior to my coding journey, I was striving to worth in the IT field. Eventually, it went down hill for me. I got laid off from my previous job. As it was going bad for me I was seeing all my friends succeeding in the things they were doing. From that I concluding that I wasn't succeeding at all. I was very envious of what those that I knew. Botton states that, "you can't be successfull at everything... you can't have it all" (Botton, 2009). After I got into Code Fellows I started to realize that even though what has happened to me was very unfortunate, it's okay. It's not the end of the world. I just need to stop worrying about other people's success and focus on my own.

## Your emotional intelligence

Right off the bat after taking the emotional intelligence test, I can see that my self-awareness score and my self-management score have both gone up. I have the school to thank for that. My social awarness and relationship management have generally stayed the same. I used to think only about myself and not about other, but that is not teh case anymore. I'm thinking about my emotions. If i'm making the right decisions base on how i'm feeling that day.

## Your Biases

With the Bias Self-Assessment, it improved a little bit. I did improve on the weakest are which was effective courage. I am a shy person at heart, but I'm learning how to build up the courage even to speak. I know this is off topic but I do feel like it has to do with COVID. Ever since it happened majority of my time was spent at home. I feel like I lost all social skills I previously had and now i'm just too afraid to even speak up sometimes. I am actually hoping to improve this a bit more since I will physically attending a class now.

## Things I want to know more about

I want to learn about building more grit. I don't know what it is but it's always been hard for me to stay consistent in anything I do. For some, it looks so easy. They don't care about anything that happens all they want to do is acheive their dreams and I commend them for that.
