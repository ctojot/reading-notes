## nosql vs sql

### What type of database is the best fit for the complex query intensive environment?

SQL Databases becuase noSQL doesn't have standard interfaces to preform complex queries.

#### What type of database is the best fit for hierarchical data storage?

noSQL because becuase it follows the key value pair way of sorting data simlar to JSON data.

### Describe the differences in scalability between a SQL and NoSQL database as though you were speaking to a non-technical friend.

SQL is like adding more shelves to a library. When the library gets full, you can add more shelves and it gets bigger and bigger. It also becomes a bit of work becuase as you're adding more shelves you have to maintain the structure of how the library is setup.

One-to-One is like a perfect match, where each thing connects to exactly one other thing. One-to-Many is like a parent-child relationship, where one thing connects to multiple other things, but each of those things connects back to just one. Many-to-Many is like a web of connections, where many things connect with many other things in various combinations.
