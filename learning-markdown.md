# Learning Markdown Notes

## What is Markdown?

- One of the most popular markup languages
- Markdown isn't the same as a word processor
- When creating markdown-formatted file, you use markdown sytanx to indicate which words or phrases should look different
- For Example

  '#' for Headings

  '*' for Italics

  '-' or '+' for Unordered Lists

- Markdown formatting elements can be added to plaintext files using text editor applications
- Accroding to John Gruber:
  > The overriding design goal for Markdown's formatting sytanx is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it's been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.

## Why Use Markdown?

- Can be used to create websites, documents, presentations, books, etc.
- Markdown files be opened using many applications making them portable
- Platform independent. You can use any device regardless of operating system to make markdown-formatted text
- Future proof. If an application you are using stops working, you can still view it through the markdown-formatted text using a text editor application
- Markdown is everywhere. Most websites, devices and applications support markdown.
