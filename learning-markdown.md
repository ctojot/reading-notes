# Learning Markdown Notes

## What is Markdown?

- One of the most popular markup languages
- Markdown isn't the same as a word processor
- When creating markdown-formatted file, you use markdown sytanx to indicate which words or phrases should look different
- Markdown formatting elements can be added to plaintext files using text editor applications
- Accroding to John Gruber:
  > The overriding design goal for Markdown's formatting sytanx is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it's been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.

## Why Use Markdown?

- Can be used to create websites, documents, presentations, books, etc.
- Markdown files be opened using many applications making them portable
- Platform independent. You can use any device regardless of operating system to make markdown-formatted text
- Future proof. If an application you are using stops working, you can still view it through the markdown-formatted text using a text editor application
- Markdown is everywhere. Most websites, devices and applications support markdown.

### Headings

  Headings use the '#' Symbol. The are 6 different ones, with 1 being the largest and 6 being the smallest.
  
  H1 '# Heading'
  
  H2 '## Heading'
  
  H3 '### Heading'
  
  H4 '#### Heading'
  
  H5 '##### Heading'
  
  H6 '###### Heading'
  

### Italics and Bold

  Both italics and bold use the asterik symbol. The only difference being, if you want to use italics you'd put one asterik before or phrase and one at the end, while bold will use two in the beginning and two at the end. You can also use an underscore symbol but it is best practice to use asteriks.
  
  
  <em> *Italics* </em>
  <strong> **Bold** </strong>
   

### Numbered Lists
