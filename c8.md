# Class 8: Operators and Loops

## Expressions and operators

- At a high level, an expression is a valid unit of code that resolves to a value
- There are two types of expressions:
  - those that have side effects
  - those that purely evaluate

- Some Operators:
  - Assignment operators
  - Comparison operators
  - Arithmetic operators
  - Bitwise operators
  - Logical operators
  - BigInt operators
  - String operators
  - Conditional (ternary) operator
  - Comma operator
  - Unary operators
  - Relational operators

- These operators join operands either formed by higher-precedence operators or one of the basic expressions
- JavaScript has both binary and unary operators, and one special ternary operator, the conditional operator

### Assignment operators

- An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand

### Assigning to properties

- If an expression evaluates to an object, then the left-hand side of an assignment expression may make assignments to properties of that expression

- In strict mode, the code above throws, because one cannot assign properties to primitives

### Destructuring

- The destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to extract data from arrays or objects using a syntax that mirrors the construction of array and object literals

### Evaluation and nesting

- In general, assignments are used within a variable declarationor as standalone statements
- Chaining assignments or nesting assignments in other expressions can result in surprising behavior
- By chaining or nesting an assignment expression, its result can itself be assigned to another variable
- When chaining these expressions without parentheses or other grouping operators like array literals, the assignment expressions are grouped right to left, but they are evaluated left to right

### Avoid assignment chains

- Chaining assignments or nesting assignments in other expressions can result in surprising behavior
- In particular, putting a variable chain in a const, let, or var statement often does not work
- Only the outermost/leftmost variable would get declared; other variables within the assignment chain are not declared by the const/let/var statement

### Comparison operators

- A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true
- Strings are compared based on standard lexicographical ordering, using Unicode values
- The sole exceptions to type conversion within comparisons involve the === and !== operators, which perform strict equality and inequality comparisons

### Arithmetic operators

- An arithmetic operator takes numerical values as their operands and returns a single numerical value
- The standard arithmetic operators are addition +, subtraction -, multiplication *, and division /
- These operators work as they do in most other programming languages when used with floating point numbers

### Bitwise Operators

- A bitwise operator treats their operands as a set of 32 bits, rather than as decimal, hexadecimal, or octal numbers

### Bitwise logical operators

- the bitwise logical operators work as follows:
  - The operands are converted to thirty-two-bit integers and expressed by a series of bits
  - Each bit in the first operand is paired with the corresponding bit in the second operand: first bit to first bit, second bit to second bit, and so on
  - The operator is applied to each pair of bits, and the result is constructed bitwise

### Bitwise shift operators

- The bitwise shift operators take two operands: the first is a quantity to be shifted, and the second specifies the number of bit positions by which the first operand is to be shifted

### Logical operators

- Logical operators are typically used with Boolean values; when they are, they return a Boolean value

### Short-circuit evaluation

- As logical expressions are evaluated left to right, they are tested for possible evaluation using the following rules:
  - false && anything is short-circuit evaluated to false
  - true || anything is short-circuit evaluated to true

- The rules of logic guarantee that these evaluations are always correct

### BigInt operators

- Most operators that can be used between numbers can be used between BigInt values as well
- BigInts and numbers are not mutually replaceable; you cannot mix them in calculations

### String operators

- In addition to the comparison operators, which can be used on string values, the concatenation operator concatenates two string values together, returning another string that is the union of the two operand strings

### Conditional (ternary) operator

- The conditional operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands. The operator can have one of two values based on a condition

### Comma operator

- The comma operator evaluates both of its operands and returns the value of the last operand

### Unary operators

- A unary operation is an operation with only one operand

### delete

- The delete operator deletes an object's property where object is the name of an object, property is an existing property, and propertyKey is a string or symbol referring to an existing propert

### Deleting array elements

- Since arrays are just objects, it's technically possible to delete elements from them
- When you delete an array property, the array length is not affected and other elements are not re-indexed

### typeof

- The typeof operator returns a string indicating the type of the unevaluated operand
- operand is the string, variable, keyword, or object for which the type is to be returned

### void

- The void operator specifies an expression to be evaluated without returning a value
- expression is a JavaScript expression to evaluate

### Relational operators

- A relational operator compares its operands and returns a Boolean value based on whether the comparison is true

### In

- The in operator returns true if the specified property is in the specified object

### instanceof

- The instanceof operator returns true if the specified object is of the specified object type
- Use instanceof when you need to confirm the type of an object at runtime

### Basic expressions

- All operators eventually operate on one or more basic expressions
- These basic expressions include identifiers and literals, but there are a few other kinds as well

### this

- Use the this keyword to refer to the current object
- n general, this refers to the calling object in a method

### Grouping operator

- The grouping operator controls the precedence of evaluation in expressions

### new

- You can use the new operator to create an instance of a user-defined object type or of one of the built-in object types

### super

- The super keyword is used to call functions on an object's parent

## Loops and iteration

- Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly
- You can think of a loop as a computerized version of the game where you tell someone to take X steps in one direction, then Y steps in another
- The statements for loops provided in JavaScript are:
  - for statement
  - do...while statement
  - while statement
  - labeled statement
  - break statement
  - continue statement
  - for...in statement
  - for...of statement

### for statement

- A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false
- The JavaScript for loop is similar to the Java and C for loop
- When a for loop executes, the following occurs:
  - The initializing expression initialization, if any, is executed
  - The condition expression is evaluated
  - The statement executes. To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ }) to group those statements
  - If present, the update expression afterthought is executed.
  - Control returns to Step 2

### Example

- In the example below, the function contains a for statement that counts the number of selected options in a scrolling list

### do...while statement

- The do...while statement repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false

### while statement

- A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true
- A while statement looks as follows:
  - If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following the loop
  - The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops, and control is passed to the statement following while
  - To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ }) to group those statements

### labeled statement

- A label provides a statement with an identifier that lets you refer to it elsewhere in your program
- The value of label may be any JavaScript identifier that is not a reserved word

### break statement

- Use the break statement to terminate a loop, switch, or in conjunction with a labeled statement
- When you use break without a label, it terminates the innermost enclosing while, do-while, for, or switch immediately and transfers control to the following statement
- When you use break with a label, it terminates the specified labeled statement

### continue statement

- The continue statement can be used to restart a while, do-while, for, or label statement

### for...in statement

- The for...in statement iterates a specified variable over all the enumerable properties of an object

### Arrays

- Although it may be tempting to use this as a way to iterate over Array elements, the for...in statement will return the name of your user-defined properties in addition to the numeric indexes

### for...of statement

- The for...of statement creates a loop Iterating over iterable objects, invoking a custom iteration hook with statements to be executed for the value of each distinct property
