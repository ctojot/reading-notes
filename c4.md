# Class 4: Structure Web Pages with HTML

## Wireframe and Design

### An Introduction to Wireframing

#### What is a Wireframe?

- Wireframing is a practice used by UX designers that allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product.
- Focuses on how a designer or client wants users to proccess information from their site based on research done by UX Designers.
- Wireframing is a great for getting to know how users interact with interfaces.
- Wireframing lets you plan the interface from the layouts to interactions.

#### Wireframe Examples

- Wireframes can be hand-drawn or created with software.
- Advantages of starting with hand-drawn creation:

  - Wireframes created via physically can be easily edited.
  - Can be tested with paper prototypes at every stage of creation
  - Cost efficient
  - Switiching to software later allows you to keep track of more detailed decisions.

- Example of a wireframe from a CareerFoundry Student

#### Things to Consider Before You Start Wireframing

- The decision to use your hands or online tools is less decided by the UX Designer, but more from the approach towards the particular situation.
- Depends largely on how much emphasis there is on visual design in a project
- a number of ways different designers can structure the process from design to implementation:
  - Wirefram > Interactive Prototype > Visual > Design
  - Sketch > Code
  - Sketch > Wireframe > Hi-Def Wireframe > Visual > Code
  - Sketch > Wireframe > Visual Code

#### The Best Tools for Wireframing

- Tons of free wireframe tools
  1. UXPin: One of the best with building responsive, clickable prototypes directly from a browser
  2. Invision: allows you to get feedback from team and users through clickable mock-ups from your site
  3. Wireframe.cc: provides you with tech to create wireframes from our browser quickly

### 6 steps to make a Wireframe

1. Do Research

    Before designing, understand who your audience is and with competitor and industry research

2. Prepare your research for Quick Reference

    Make something you can refer to at anytime when you need it so you don't forget the important things

3. Make sure you have your user flow mapped out

    Important to have a clear cut concept of where the users will be coming from.

4. Draft, don't draw. Sketch don't illistrate.

    Outlining and representing features. No detail necessary. Think of these questions when sketching:
      - How can you organize the content to support your users goal?
      - What info is most important and where will your message go?
      - What is the user expected to see on certain pages?
      - What does the user need to do to complete the desired action?

5. Add some detail and get testing

    Once majority of the concept is done, start adding in details little by little

6. Start tuning your wireframes into prototypes

    Once you've acted upon all the feedback from the first prototype, you fan start transitioning into a more high quality prototype

## How to Make Your Wireframe Good: Three Key Principles

1. Clarity

    Wireframe needs to explain to user why it exists, what the purpose of the website is for

2. Confidence

    Giving users the confidence to nagivate through the website with ease using common navigation placements. 
    
3. Simplicity is Key

    Your wireframe is a visual guide to the framework of your website. No need for extra fluff or too much information. 

## HTML Basics

### So What is HTML

- **Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML)**: is the code that is used to structure a website and its content
- consits of series of elements you use to control how content looks a certain way

### Anatomy of HTML

1. The opening tag: consits of the name of the element wrapped in opening and closing brackets. Indicates where the element starts
2. The Closing tag: similar to the opening tag, however it indicates where the element ends and also includes a forward slash right before the element name
3. The content: the content of the element can consist of text, a link, a picture, all depending on the element
4. The element: opening, closing and the content together comprise the element

- attributes: contain extra information about the element that you don't want appearing in the actual content
- attributes that set a value always have:
  1. a space between it and the element name
  2. attribute name followed by an equal sign
  3. attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks

### Nesting Elements

- elements inside of other elements is called nesting
- must make sure elements are properly nested

### Void Elements

- Elements with no content are considered **void elements**.

### Anatomy of an HTML Document

- **doctype**: a required preamble
- **html**: element wraps all the content on the entire page
- **head**: element acts as a container for all info you want to include on the HTML but ins't content you are showing to users
- **viewport element**: ensures the page renders at the width of view point
- **title**: sets the title of your page
- **body**: contains all the content that you want to show your web users

## Images

- img consists of src, the source of the image and alt, descriptive text about the img

## Marking up text

### Headings

- headings allow you to specify certain part of the website as being part of the heading

### Paragraphs

- paragraph elements is used to contain a paragraph of text 

### Lists

1. Ordered list
2. Unordered list

### Links

- represented with a, being a short form for anchor
- usually given href as an attribute
- href= url

## Semantics

- in code semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code

### Semantics in JavaScript

- In JavaScript, consider a function that takes a string parameter, and returns an ' li ' element with that string as its textContent

### Semantics in CSS

- consider styling a list with li elements represeting different types of fruit

### Semantics in HTML

- H1 is a semantic element
- Gives the text it wraps around the role of "a top level heading" on a page
- You can make other elements render as a top level heading but it has no semantic value
- Important to use the correct elements at correct times
- Benefits of writing semantic markup:
  
  - search engines consider its content as important key words
  - screen readers can use it as a sign post
  - significantly easier to use easier codes than scowering the lists for complicated ones
  - suggest to the developer the type of data that will be populated
  - semantic naming mirrors proper custom element/component nameing

- "What element(s) best describe/represent the data that im going to populate?"
