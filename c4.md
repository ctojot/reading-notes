- Wireframing lets you plan the interface from the layouts to interactions.

#### Wireframe Examples

- Wireframes can be hand-drawn or created with software.
- Advantages of starting with hand-drawn creation:

  - Wireframes created via physically can be easily edited.
  - Can be tested with paper prototypes at every stage of creation
