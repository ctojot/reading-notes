# Class 3: Revisons and the Cloud

## Git Intro

### Version Control

- **Version Control**: a system that allows you to revist various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes

### Local Version Control

- **Local Version Control**: entails one database on your HD that stores changes to files

### Centralized Version Control

- **Centralized Version Control System (CVCS)**: a single server storing all changes and file versions that can be accessed by various clients
- Server being single point of failure creating major vulnerability

### Distributed Version Control

- **Distributed Version Control (DVCS)** : allows clients to create mirrored repositories
- If CVS goes down, collaborators cannot work with each other on files or save on newer ones
- Because the DVCS allows for multiple mirrored repositories, programmers can collaborate with each other in various ways to create simultaneous workflows

### So what is Git?

#### Snapshots

- **Git**: a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots
- Each time you commit, git creates a snapshot and stores it for reference

#### Local Operations

- Git relies on local operations becuase most necessary information can be found in local resources
- Allows for process expediency and allows one to work on a project without being online or on a vpn

#### Tracking Changes

- Every single change applied to any file or directory is tracked by Git and it will always detect file corruption or loss of information in transit

#### Loss of Data

- Git is set up to greatly minimize the possibility of irreversible damage to files, such as accidentally lost data
- Git makes it extremely difficult for a snapshot of your file that is committed to be lost

#### States

- Files in Git can reside in three main states: committed, modified and staged.
- **Commited**: Data is securely stored in a local database
- **Modified**: File has been changed but not committed to the database
- **Staged**: Flagged a fileâ€™s changed version to be committed in the next snapshot
