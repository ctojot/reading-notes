# Class 2: The Coder's Computer

## Choosing a Text Editor

- Text Editors accomplish the same goal
- Some have better features than others
- All personal choice

### What is a Text Editor

- a **text editor** is a piece of software that you download that allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that let you build a website.
- Most important features of a text editor:
    1. Code Completion
    2. Syntax Highlighting
    3. Variety of themes
    4. Healthy variety of extensions

- **Code completion**: allows you to start typing and then will display possible suggestions on what to finish with based on what you typed. Can also include closing tags and brackets
- **Syntax highlighting**: takes text that you typed and makes it more noticeable with colored text. Makes it easier to spot errors and differences
- **Themes**: allow you to change the color of the background of your text editor. Puts less strain on your eyes
- **Extensions**: plugins for the text editor. Adds functionality
- The deeper you get into coding, the more features you'll want and need to make it a smoother experience

### Using the Software That Already Comes With Your Computer

- Windows: notepad
- Mac: Text Edit
- Linux: each distribution has its own text editor
- You can use these text editors to make websites, but will become a hassle without any features

### The Differences Between Text Editors and IDEs

- Text editors edit text
- **IDE**: is a suite of different software
- an IDE can be a text a file
manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package.

## The Command Line
### So what are they?

- A **command line**, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system
- You can type commands on a keyboard and you ill recieve feedback in similar to a text

### Opening a Terminal

- Fairly simple to access
- Mac: Applications -> Utilites -> Terminal
- Linux: can either be Applications -> System or Application -> Utilities depending on the distribution. (Sometimes you can right-click the desktop and you'll see an "Open Terminal" option)
- Windows: Requires an SSH Client

### The Shell, Bash

- **Shell**: part of the operating system that defines how the terminal will behave and looks after running commands
- Most common shell is **bash**.

### Shortcuts

- There are thousands of shortcuts to make coding easier

## Basic Navigation

### So where are we?

- **pwd**: Print Working Directory. Tells you the current directory you are in.

### What's in our Current Location?

- **ls**: list contents of current directory 

### Paths

- Whenever we refer to a file or a directory, there are 2 paths **absolute** and **relative**
- Relative path: A file or directory location relative to where we currently are in the file system
- Absolute path: A file or directory location in relation to the root of the file system.
- **Root**: very top of the hierarchical structure. Single slash ( / )
- Absolute paths specify a location in relation to the root direcotry. Identified by a forward slash ( / )
Relative paths specify location in relation to where you currently are in the system. *Will not begin with a slash*.

### Let's Move Around a Bit

- **cd**: Change Directory. Move to another directory
- if you run the command cd without any arguments then it will always take you back to your home directory

## More About Files

### Everything is a File

- Everything is a file under linux

### Linux is an Extensionless System

- a file extension is a set of 2 - 4 after a full stop at the end of a file
- extensions also tell you what kind of file it is
-**file**: obtain information about what type of file a file or directory is
- **ls -a**: List the contents of a directory, including hidden files
