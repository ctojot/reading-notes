# Class 2: The Coder's Computer

## Choosing a Text Editor

- Text Editors accomplish the same goal
- Some have better features than others
- All personal choice

### What is a Text Editor

- a **text editor** is a piece of software that you download that allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that let you build a website.
- Most important features of a text editor:
    1. Code Completion
    2. Syntax Highlighting
    3. Variety of themes
    4. Healthy variety of extensions

- **Code completion**: allows you to start typing and then will display possible suggestions on what to finish with based on what you typed. Can also include closing tags and brackets
- **Syntax highlighting**: takes text that you typed and makes it more noticeable with colored text. Makes it easier to spot errors and differences
- **Themes**: allow you to change the color of the background of your text editor. Puts less strain on your eyes
- **Extensions**: plugins for the text editor. Adds functionality
- The deeper you get into coding, the more features you'll want and need to make it a smoother experience

### Using the Software That Already Comes With Your Computer

- Windows: notepad
- Mac: Text Edit
- Linux: each distribution has its own text editor
- You can use these text editors to make websites, but will become a hassle without any features

### The Differences Between Text Editors and IDEs

- Text editors edit text
- **IDE**: is a suite of different software
