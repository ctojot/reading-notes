# Class 7: Programming with JavaScript

## Control flow

- The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script
- code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops
- A typical script in JavaScript or PHP includes many control structures, including conditionals, loops and functions
- Control flow means that when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structure and how it affects order of execution

## JavaScript Functions

- A function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task
- A function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it)

### JavaScript Function Syntax

- A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ()
- Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs
- The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas
- The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets

### Function Invocation

- code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function: 
  - When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
  - When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
  - Automatically (self invoked)

### Function Return

- When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing
- If the function was invoked from a statement, JavaScript will "return" to execute the code after the invoking statement
- Functions often compute a return value. The return value is "returned" back to the "caller"

### Why Functions?

- You can use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce different results

### The () Operator Invokes the Function

- Using the example above, toCelsius refers to the function object, and toCelsius() refers to the function result

### Functions Used as Variable Values

- Functions can be used the same way as you use variables, in all types of formulas, assignments, and calculations

### Local Variables

- Local variables can only be accessed from within the function

## JavaScript Operators

- The Addition Operator + adds numbers
- The Assignment Operator = assigns a value to a variable

### JavaScript Assignment

- The Assignment Operator = assigns a value to a variable

### JavaScript Addition

- The Addition Operator + adds numbers

### JavaScript Multiplication

- The Multiplication Operator * multiplies numbers

### Types of JavaScript Operators

- There are different types of JavaScript operators:
  - Arithmetic Operators
  - Assignment Operators
  - Comparison Operators
  - String Operators
  - Logical Operators
  - Bitwise Operators
  - Ternary Operators
  - Type Operators

### JavaScript Arithmetic Operators

- Arithmetic Operators are used to perform arithmetic on numbers

### JavaScript Assignment Operators

- The Addition Assignment Operator += adds a value to a variable

### JavaScript String Addition

- The + can also be used to add (concatenate) strings

### Adding Strings and Numbers

- Adding two numbers, will return the sum, but adding a number and a string will return a string
