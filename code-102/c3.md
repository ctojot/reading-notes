# Class 3: Revisons and the Cloud

## Git Intro

### Version Control

- **Version Control**: a system that allows you to revist various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes

### Local Version Control

- **Local Version Control**: entails one database on your HD that stores changes to files

### Centralized Version Control

- **Centralized Version Control System (CVCS)**: a single server storing all changes and file versions that can be accessed by various clients
- Server being single point of failure creating major vulnerability

### Distributed Version Control

- **Distributed Version Control (DVCS)** : allows clients to create mirrored repositories
- If CVS goes down, collaborators cannot work with each other on files or save on newer ones
- Because the DVCS allows for multiple mirrored repositories, programmers can collaborate with each other in various ways to create simultaneous workflows

### So what is Git?

#### Snapshots

- **Git**: a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots
- Each time you commit, git creates a snapshot and stores it for reference

#### Local Operations

- Git relies on local operations becuase most necessary information can be found in local resources
- Allows for process expediency and allows one to work on a project without being online or on a vpn

#### Tracking Changes

- Every single change applied to any file or directory is tracked by Git and it will always detect file corruption or loss of information in transit

#### Loss of Data

- Git is set up to greatly minimize the possibility of irreversible damage to files, such as accidentally lost data
- Git makes it extremely difficult for a snapshot of your file that is committed to be lost

#### States

- Files in Git can reside in three main states: committed, modified and staged.
- **Commited**: Data is securely stored in a local database
- **Modified**: File has been changed but not committed to the database
- **Staged**: Flagged a file’s changed version to be committed in the next snapshot

## Getting Started

### Initial Customization

#### Configuration Variables

- **git config**: allows the setting of configuration variables that control aspects of Git's operation and look

#### Identity Setting

- Users should set up username and email that will be used by Git for every commit

### Default Text Editor

- without configuration of a text ediotr, Git will use system's default editor

### Checking Settings

- **git config --list**: to check settings

### Getting Help

- 3 ways of getting help
    1. git help command
    2. git command --help
    3. man git-command

## Setting up a Repository

### Importing


1. Switch to target directory
2. Use the git init command
3. To start tracking these repository files, perform an initial commit by typing the following:
    - git add *.c
    - git add LICENSE
    - git commit -m "any msg here"

### Cloning

- **git clone (github link)**: command for cloning from connected repository
- Copies all versions of a file for a project

## Workflow

### Local Repository Structure

- Local git repository has 3 components
  - Working Directory: actual files reside here
  - Index: The area used for staging
  - Head: Points to the most recent commit

### Saving Changes

- **Tracked**: tracked files can be modified, unmodified, or staged; part of the most recent file snapshot
- **Untracked**: untracked files were not in the last snap shot and are not in the staging are

### The Life Cycle of File Status

1. After you edit a file, Git flags it as modified
2. Stage the modified file
3. Commit staged changes

### Check File Status

- **git status**: checks state of files

### Tracking and Staging a New File

#### Single File

- **git add filename**: to track one file

#### All Files

- __git add *__: to track all files in a repository
- After these command all files are tracked and staged for comitting

### Committing a File

- **git commit -m "text"**: command to commit one or multiple files with a special commit message

### Committing All Changes

- **git commit -a: commit all changes with no message

### Pushing Changes

- **git push origin main**: pushes changes from local master branch to remote named origin

### Stashing Changes

- **git stash**: when your not ready to commit changes but dont want to lose them

-**git stash apply**: to finish commit when you are ready

## Remote Repositories

### Cloned Repositories

- Git automatically gives the name “origin” to the server from which you cloned and the name “master” to the local branch

### Seeing Your Remotes

- **git remote**: can view short names of all specified remote handles
- **git remot -v**: can view all the remote URLs next to their corresponding short names
